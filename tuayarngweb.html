            <h1 class="w3-center">ABOUT US</h1>

            <p> Our company has officially started cultivating and nurturing coffee, launching the project in July 2012
                in
                Kongtun Village, Pakxong District, Champasak Province.
                Currently, the company has a total coffee plantation area of 150 hectares, with 130 hectares already
                bearing
                fruit. The plantation is expanded gradually each year, while also researching and addressing risks from
                diseases and pests, such as fungi, aphids, stem borers, coffee berry borers, and nutrient deficiencies.
                Additionally, natural disasters like drought, frost, and salt mist (which can kill coffee trees
                overnight)
                pose challenges.
                Despite these challenges, our company has successfully implemented preventive and corrective measures,
                ensuring a thriving coffee plantation. From 2018 to the present, there have been no tree losses due to
                diseases, pests, or natural disasters. The coffee plants continue to flourish and produce consistently
                increasing yields.
                In summary, as of today, the company has successfully completed the first milestone in establishing a
                high-quality coffee plantation with strong sustainability and a stable market.</p>

                    <p>From the practical implementation and lessons learned, it can be concluded that:

                        The Bolaven Plateau region has a high potential for coffee production and can enhance its
                        production
                        capacity to be on par with other leading coffee-producing countries. The company’s experience
                        has
                        demonstrated that Arabica coffee can achieve yields of 15-20 tons per hectare, while Robusta
                        coffee
                        can reach 25-30 tons per hectare, consistently every year. If these targets are met, the revenue
                        per
                        hectare will not be less than 40-60 million Kip. When compared to production costs, it is
                        evident
                        that coffee cultivation in this region is profitable and sustainable.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>To support the development of high-quality and high-yield coffee cultivation in the Bolaven Plateau,
                based on real-world experience, in 2020 a cooperative group of coffee producers and exporters from
                Paksong, Laongam, and Thateng districts, along with foreign investors, engaged in field studies,
                knowledge exchange, and confirmed that the region has high production potential, excellent quality,
                and a stable market.With this in mind, the company aims to promote and expand the production of
                high-quality
                coffee with stable market access in collaboration with local farmers who are committed to sustainable
                cultivation. This aligns with Laos' 2+3 agricultural policy.
                At the same time, the company urges the government to facilitate access to financial resources by
                providing low-interest loans for both farmers and businesses, ensuring that they have the necessary
                capital for production. Additionally, there is a need to improve organizational structures by
                establishing cooperatives or production groups, ensuring stronger producer networks, guaranteed
                production volumes, and consistent quality.
                Furthermore, expanding international coffee markets is crucial, especially by strengthening trade
                ties with neighboring countries.</p>
